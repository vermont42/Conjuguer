## Conjuguer

**Conjuguer** is a nascent iOS™ app for learning French verb conjugations. Eventually, **Conjuguer** will conjugate _all_ French verbs, regular and irregular, in _all_ French verb tenses.

**Conjuguer** shares and will share features with its Spanish-verb predecessor, [Conjugar](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conjugar/id1236500467?mt=8), but **Conjuguer** represents conjugation irregularities in a more parsimonious manner, allowing **Conjuguer** to conjugate more verbs. All of them, in fact.

Unlike Conjugar, **Conjuguer** contains verb frequency-of-use data, which allows learners to focus their studies on the most important verbs.

**Conjuguer** is licensed under the GNU General Public License in order to discourage release of low-quality clones to the App Store™. Conjugar briefly suffered this indignity.

### TODOs

* Add 5500+ French verbs.
* Get frequency data for more verbs.
* Add quiz mode and integrate with Game Center™.
* Internationalize and then localize for French.
* Add descriptions of tenses.
* Add a help button to explain endings and stem alterations on the verb-model screen.
* Add unit tests for non-SwiftUI code. There _are_ unit tests for all eighty verb models and for all compound tenses.
* Ensure that the app takes full advantage of accessibility APIs and features.
* Hire a designer to create an app icon and other icons.
* Create a Vapor-based analytics backend and instrument the client.
* Put iOS-specific, SwiftUI, and verb-conjugation code in separate frameworks to facilitate a Mac port.
* Allow users to specify pronoun genders.
* I salute you for reading this far.
