Privacy Policy
===================

Conjuguer uses the Amazon Web Services&trade; analytics product, Pinpoint&trade;, to track certain information or "analytics". These analytics consist of:

* Launching the app
* Each screen visited
* Starting a quiz
* Quitting a quiz, with number of verbs conjugated
* Finishing a quiz, with score
* Game Center&trade; authentication
* App version
* Unique installs
* Device model
* Country and language of user

Conjuguer does _not_ track any personally identifiable user information.

As demonstrated in the following example, analytics inform future development of Conjuguer.

In Conjuguer's predecessor, Conjugar, quizzes had fifty verbs. According to analytics, most quizzes went unfinished. Quiz-takers gave up. In order to facilitate quiz completion, Conjuguer's quizzes have only thirty verbs.

Please direct any questions about or feedback on this privacy policy to Conjuguer's [developer](mailto:vermontcoder@gmail.com).
