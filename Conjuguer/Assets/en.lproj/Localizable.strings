"Info.dedicationText" = "David Compton was my high-school Nordic-skiing coach. He was also a French teacher but not initially ~my~ French teacher. He was aware of my interest in and aptitude for French, however. At the beginning of my junior year, I wasn’t going to be able to take French because of a schedule conflict with Advanced Placement English. So Mr. Compton created a five-days-a-week French-literature class just for me. A German exchange student named Julian Peters soon joined us. Using Volumes I and II of “Anthologie de la Littérature Française” by Robert Leggewie as our textbooks, we studied the greats of French literature from Chrétien de Troyes to Samuel Beckett. This literary study ultimately inspired ~Conjuguer~’s use of literary examples of tense use. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr Compton’s class, and my knowledge of French took a giant leap. At the end of the year, I achieved a maximum score on the French Advanced Placement test. At the beginning of my freshman year at Dartmouth College, I took a test to get credit for a major-level French class and, of the sixty freshmen who took the test, I was one of only three who passed.

Mr. Compton already had a full class schedule in the fall of 1991, when he created the class for me. On some level, he might have enjoyed spending that class period puffing on his tobacco pipe, tinkering with his Macintosh computer. Solipsistic teen that I was, I never asked him ~why~ he sacrificed that time for me. But I can speculate. He studied at the Sorbonne during the 1960s and was a francophile. He may have recognized in me a shared interest in French and wanted to give me the opportunity to pursue it to the fullest extent possible. Whatever his motivation, I am grateful and dedicate this app to him.

Thanks to Mr. Compton, the name of ~Conjuguer~ is correctly spelled. During my freshman year at Dartmouth College, I developed the predecessor to ~Conjuguer~, ~Le Conjugateur~, a HyperCard stack. During a break from school, I demonstrated ~Le Conjugateur~ to Mr. Compton. He was impressed but commented that I was consistently misspelling the French word for “conjugate”, “conjuguer”, as “conjuger”. A rapid correction ensued and endured.";

"Info.terminologyHeading" = "Terminology";

"Info.terminologyText" = "`Verb`

A ~verb~ is a kind of word that describes an action. For example, in the sentence “Jacques Brel played the guitar”, “play” is the verb. Likewise, in the sentence “Jacques Brel jouait de la guitare”, “jouer” is the verb. Verb ~tense~s express, among other things, when an action took, takes, or will take place. In the example sentences, the verb tenses indicate that the action (playing the guitar) took place in the past. In English and in French, the ~subject~ or actor in the sentence, combined with the tense, determine the form of the verb used. This is the verb ~conjugation~. In English, the example sentence’s combination of subject and tense results in the conjugation “played”. In French, the conjugation is “jouait”.

The ~infinitif~ (infinitive) is an invariant verb form that usually ends in -er, -ir, or -re. Unlike a conjugation, an ~infinitif~ does not indicate time, number, or person. Example use: “Jacques Brel savait ~chanter~.” = “Jacques Brel $knEw$ how ~to sing~.” In both sentences, the infinitif represents the ~act~ of singing without reference to time, number, or person.

French dictionaries and ~Conjuguer~’s Verbs tab list infinitif forms of verbs.

The ~radical de l’infinitif~ (infinitive stem) is the infinitif minus its -er, -ir, or -re ending. This stem is the base for most conjugations.

`Pronoun`

A subject ~pronoun~ is a word that stands in for the subject in a sentence. The subject is the actor. In English, the subject pronouns in widespread use are ~I~, ~you~, ~he/she/it/one~, ~we~, ~you/y’all~, and ~they~. The English subject pronouns ~ye~ and ~thou~ have been in decline since the Elizabethan period.

Subject pronouns correspond to the ~singular~ or ~plural~ number and to the ~first person~, ~second person~, or ~third person~. English subject pronouns follow. Abbreviations of the person-number combinations are in parentheses.

first person, singular (1s): ~I~
second person, singular (2s): ~you~
third person, singular (3s): ~he/she/it/one~
first person, plural (1p): ~we~
second person, plural (2p): ~you/y’all~
third person, plural (3p): ~they~

Except with respect to 2s, the choice of subject pronoun in French is straightforward.

1s: ~je~
3s: ~il~ (masc.)/~elle~ (fem.)/~on~
1p: ~nous~
2p: ~vous~
3p: ~ils~ (masc.)/~elles~ (fem.)

“Fem.” means that a pronoun refers to female subjects, and “masc.” means that a pronoun refers to male subjects.

In quotidian speech, “on” replaces “nous” and uses 3s conjugations.

With respect to 2s, there are two choices: ~tu~ and ~vous~. ~Tu~ and its conjugations express intimacy, familiarity, friendliness, or, when used in anger on a stranger, rudeness. ~Vous~ and its conjugations express politeness, respect, or, when used on a former intimate, desire for emotional distance.

`Order of Presentation of Conjugations`

Treatises on French verbs, when presenting the conjugations for a particular tense, use the following person-number order: 1s, 2s, 3s, 1p, 2p, 3p. Respecting tradition, ~Conjuguer~ does the same. For example, ~Conjuguer~ would present the indicatif-présent conjugations of ~être~ as follows:

$SUIs$, $Es$, $ESt$, $SOMMEs$, $êteS$, $SOnt$

Red letters in conjugations represent irregularities. A verb is considered irregular if any of its conjugations differs from the conjugation of a regular ~er~, ~ir~, or ~re~ verb.";

"Info.irregularitiesHeading" = "Irregularities";

"Info.irregularitiesText" = "Of the 6,314 verbs in ~Conjuguer~, 5,217 have conjugations that are completely regular. A completely regular conjugation uses the radical de l’infinitif as its stem, and the ending is completely predictable. These are verbs that are conjugated using verb models 1-1 (regular -er), 2-1 (regular -ir), and 5-1A (regular -re). Examples:

cacaber -> vous cacabâtes
alunir -> nous alunissons
épandre -> épandu

The other 1,097 verbs are conjugated using one of ninety-two irregular-verb models. Verb models exhibit irregularities in three ways.

First, the stem used differs from the radical de l’infinitif, but the ending is predictable. Example:

suivre -> je $suIs$ (~not~ suivs)

Second, the stem is as expected, but the ending is unpredictable. Example:

être -> vous $êteS$ (~not~ êtez)

Third, both the stem ~and~ ending are unpredictable. Example:

aller -> elles $VOnt$ (~not~ allent)

~Conjuguer~ represents stem alterations and unpredictable endings for verb models in the following manner:

~[tenses to apply this alteration to]~: ~[number of letters from end of radical de l’infinitif]~, ~[number of letters to replace]~, ~[letters to swap in]~

Here is an example. The model for boire, 2-17, has the following alteration:

r1p, r2p, b1p, b2p: 2, 2, UV

This alteration results in the following conjugations:

nous $bUVons$ (~not~ boions)
vous $bUVez$ (~not~ boiez)
nous $bUVions$ (~not~ boiions)
vous $bUViez$ (~not~ boiiez)

~Conjuguer~ colors capital letters in alterations red, signifying irregularity.

An asterisk at the end of letters to swap in means an unpredictable ending. For example, the model for valoir, 4-5A, has the following alteration:

r1s, r2s: 1, 1, UX*

This alteration results in the following conjugations:

je $vaUX$ (~not~ $vaUs$)
tu $vaUX$ (~not~ $vaUs$)

Here is how tenses are represented in the alterations:

pp: participe passé
rr: participe présent
sf: radical du futur
r1s, r2s, r3s, r1p, r2p, r3p: six person-numbers of the indicatif présent
b1s, b2s, b3s, b1p, b2p, b3p: six person-numbers of the subjonctif présent
x1s, x2s, x3s, x1p, x2p, x3p: six person-numbers of the passé simple
i1s, i2s, i3s, i1p, i2p, i3p: six person-numbers of the imparfait
q1s, q2s, q3s, q1p, q2p, q3p: six person-numbers of the subjonctif imparfait
h2s, h1p, h2p: three person-numbers of the impératif

The person-number ~A~ means “all six”. For example, xA is equivalent to x1s, x2s, x3s, x1p, x2p, x3p. Likewise, rA is equivalent to r1s, r2s, r3s, r1p, r2p, r3p.

For example, the model for avoir, 4-10, has the following alteration:

xA: 2, 2, E

This results in following passé-simple conjugations:

$Eus$, $Eus$, $Eut$, $Eûmes$, $Eûtes$, $Eurent$

Some alterations have @ as the letter to swap in. This means “capitalize the first letter of the conjugation to indicate its irregularity”.

For example, the model for pouvoir, 4-6, has the following alteration:

xA, pp: 4, 4, @

This results in following passé-simple conjugations:

$Pus$, $Pus$, $Put$, $Pûmes$, $Pûtes$, $Purent$

The participe passé is $Pu$.";

"Info.defectivenessHeading" = "Defectiveness";

"Info.defectivenessText" = "`Types`

Sixty-five French verbs are ~defective~. This doesn’t mean that something is wrong with them. No, defective in this context means that these verbs lack certain or even all conjugations. Verbs may be considered defective for a variety of reasons.

1. Use of certain person-numbers would be non-sensical. For example, “je $faUX$ que tu restes” would ~literally~ mean “I $AM$ necessary that you stay”. %Falloir% is therefore defective for all person-numbers except 3s. “Il $faUt$ que tu restes” makes sense, meaning “it $IS$ necessary that you stay”.

2. Some verbs are impersonal. This doesn’t mean that they lack that human touch. No, impersonal in this context means that their subject is, in English, generic “it” or, in French, generic “il”. These verbs involve natural phenomena like snow, hail, sleet, and rain. “Il $pleuT$.” = “It is raining.” Because of the customary “il” subjects, these verbs are considered defective for person-numbers other than 3s. There is, however, ~some~ flexibility. Quoting and translating Voltaire, “Les calomnies pleuvent sur quiconque réussit.” = “Calumnies rain on whoever succeeds.” One could imagine other person-numbers being used for impersonal verbs in poetry. For example, in a poem written from the perspective of nature, the pronoun and conjugation “je neige”, meaning “I $AM$ snowing”, would make sense.

3. Some verbs are defective in certain tenses in order to avoid confusion with other verbs’ conjugations. For example, %paître% is defective in the %passé simple% because the conjugations suggested by analogy with %connaître%, $Pus$, $Pus$, $Put$, $Pûmes$, $Pûtes$, and $Purent$, are identical to %pouvoir%’s passé-simple conjugations.

4. Some verbs are defective because they have fallen out of use except in certain fixed expressions. %Ouïr (trad.)% (to hear or listen) has been replaced by %entendre% and %écouter% except in the expressions “oui-dire” = “hearsay” and “O$Yez$!” = “Listen!” (addressing Parliament). %Ester% (to be or stay) has been replaced by %être% and %rester% except in the expression “ester en justice” = “be a party in legal proceedings”. %Gésir% (to lie prone) ~is~ still occasionally used in the %indicatif présent% and %imparfait%, but the ~primary~ use of this verb is “ci-$gÎt$” = “here lies (dead)”, a common tombstone inscription.

`Reasons for Inclusion`

Reference works on French verbs, for example the book “French Verbs Made Simple(r)” and the website Wiktionary, omit defective conjugations entirely. But the developer of ~Conjuguer~ is providing ~all~ conjugations, including those traditionally considered defective, to you, the user of this app. Three reasons for this heterodox generosity follow.

1. As stated in “French Verbs Made Simple(r)”, “There is occasionally disagreement [among] various sources as to which [conjugations] actually exist.” Similarly, regarding the word %ravoir%, Wiktionary says, “D’après la plupart des dictionnaires classiques, ce verbe $EST$ défectif et ne se conjugue pas. Néanmoins, des usages de formes conjuguées $SONT$ avérées régionalement.” To omit certain conjugations, therefore, would require a series of judgment calls by the developer of ~Conjuguer~. He judgeth not lest he be judged.

2. Certain conjugations are likely absent from any large corpus of French text and could therefore be considered defective. But the fact that a conjugation $Is$n’t used doesn’t mean that it couldn’t be useful. Consider a poem written from the perspective of the clouds of Earth and Venus. This poem might include the line “We rain water and sulphuric acid, respectively.” Thus, although pleuvoir is considered defective for 1p in all conjugated tenses, this conjugation (pleuvons) would be useful in such a poem.

3. %Ester% (to be or stay), though nearly extinct in French, has heavily used relatives in other Romance languages. For example, Spanish has two words for “to be”: “ser” and (you guessed it) “estar”. ~Conjuguer~’s users might be curious how ester’s conjugations would have evolved had that verb remained productive in French, as it did in Spanish. Similarly, ~Conjuguer~’s users might also be curious how %clore%’s conjugations would have evolved had %fermer% not replaced it. For the benefit of curious users, ~Conjuguer~ includes speculative conjugations of %choir%, %clore%, %ester%, %gésir%, %issir%, and %ouïr%, inspired by the Old French conjugations provided by Wiktionary and “Tableaux de conjugaison de l’ancien français” by Machio Okada and Hitoshi Ogurisu.

Notwithstanding ~Conjuguer~’s inclusive approach to conjugations traditionally considered defective, those conjugations ~are~ called out with strikethrough in ~Conjuguer~’s user interface.";

"Info.participePasséHeading" = "Participe Passé";

"Info.participePasséText" = "`Use`

The ~participe passé~ (past participle) is used with the auxiliary verbs ~avoir~ and ~être~ to form certain compound tenses, including the %passé composé%: “j’ai parlé” = “I $spOke$”, “I $dID$ speak”, or “I have $spOken$”. The participe passé is also used to form an adjective or noun from a verb: “temps perdu” = “lost time”, “l’$inconNu$” = “the unknown”.

`Form`

In general, the participe passé is formed by adding the following endings to the radical de l’infinitif:

Regular ~er~ verbs: -é

Examples: “parlé” = “$spOken$”, “chanté” = “$sUng$”, “dansé” = “danced”

Regular ~ir~ verbs: -i

Examples: “fini” = “finished”, “établi” = “established”, “évanoui” = “fainted”

Regular ~re~ verbs: -u

Examples: “entendu” = “heard”, “vendu” = “$sOld$”, “rendu” = “rendered”

`Agreement`

When the participe passé is used as an adjective, it agrees in both gender and number with the noun it modifies. Example: “des langues parlées en France” = “some languages $spOken$ in France”

The participe passé, used in compound tenses, agrees in gender and number with the subject in two scenarios.

One scenario involves reflexive use of verbs. “Les chattes se sont nettoyées.” = “The female cats groomed themselves.”

The other scenario involves certain verbs that use the auxiliary %être% rather than %avoir%: %aller%, %arriver%, %descendre%, %devenir%, %entrer%, %issir%, %monter%, %mourir%, %naître%, %partir%, %parvenir%, %passer%, %ressortir%, %rester%, %retomber%, %retourner%, %revenir%, %sortir (exit)%, and %tomber%. Confusingly, verbs in this list use %avoir%, without agreement, in transitive situations.

Contrast:

“Elle est sortie.” = “She $leFt$.”

with:

“Elle a sorti son portefeuille.” = “She $gOt$ her wallet out.”

Note the absence of agreement in the second conjugation of sortir.

`Irregularities`

Here are some irregular participes passés:

%absoudre% -> $absouS$
%acquérir% -> $acquIs$
%asseoir% -> $assIS$
%avoir% -> $EU$
%boire% -> $bU$
%comprendre% -> $comprIS$
%connaître% -> $connU$
%coudre% -> $couSu$
%couvrir% -> $couvERT$
%croire% -> $crU$
%croître% -> $crÛ$
%devoir% -> $DÛ$
%dire% -> $diT$
%être% -> $ÉtÉ$
%exclure% -> $exclU$
%faire% -> $faiT$
%falloir% -> $fallU$
%gésir% -> $gÉÜ$
%issir% -> $issU$
%lire% -> $lU$
%mettre% -> $mIS$
%moudre% -> $mouLu$
%mourir% -> $moRT$
%mouvoir% -> $MÛ$
%nuire% -> $nuI$
%ouvrir% -> $ouvERT$
%plaindre% -> $plainT$
%plaire% -> $plU$
%pleuvoir% -> $plU$
%pouvoir% -> $PU$

%rire% -> $rI$
%savoir% -> $sU$
%suffire% -> $suffI$
%suivre% -> $suivIS$
%surseoir% -> $sursIS$
%tenir% -> $tenU$
%venir% -> $venU$
%vivre% -> $vÉCu$
%vouloir% -> $voulU$

Verbs derived from the above verbs use variants of these irregular participes passés. Example:

%ravoir% -> $rEU$";

"Info.participePrésentHeading" = "Participe Présent";

"Info.participePrésentText" = "`Uses`

The ~participe présent~ (present participle) is used:

• As an invariable verb referring to a noun or pronoun.

“[M]es parents, n’$aYant$ guère de loisir pour faire des sorties … prirent l’habitude de me laisser aller me promener sans eux.” = “My parents, having little time to go out … $gOt$ into the habit of letting me go for a walk without them.”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

• In a participle clause.

“Il n’avait … aucune raison de haïr ce bon Charles, n’$Étant$ pas ce qui s’appelle dévoré de jalousie.” = “He $haD$ … no reason to hate good Charles, not being … devoured by jealousy.”

- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

• Or as an adjective. In this case, the participe présent agrees with the noun being modified.

“Gervaise avait gardé sa tranquillité souriante de la matinée.” = “Gervaise $haD$ kept her smiling tranquility of the morning.”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

`Form`

The participe présent is formed from the 1p indicatif-présent conjugation, minus -ons, plus -ant. Examples:

%parler% -> parlant
%finir% -> finissant
%rendre% -> rendant

Three participes présents do not follow this pattern and are therefore irregular:

%avoir% -> $aYant$
%être% -> $Étant$
%savoir% -> $saCHant$";

"Info.radicalFuturHeading" = "Radical du Futur";

"Info.radicalFuturText" = "`Uses`

The ~radical du futur~ (future stem) has two uses:

• As the stem for the %futur simple%.

“La noce $aUra$ lieu le samedi 29 juillet.” = “The wedding will take place on Saturday, July 29.”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

• As the stem for the %conditionnel présent%.

“[O]n rêvait à la quantité de plats qu’il $faUDrait$ et quelles $SEraient$ les entrées.” = “One $dreamT$ of the quantity of dishes that would be needed and what the starters would be.”

- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

`Form`

For most verbs, the radical du futur is identical to the infinitif. The final -e is dropped from -re verbs. Examples:

%finir% -> finir-
%parler% -> parler-
%rendre% -> rendr-

Certain verbs have irregular radicaux futurs. They are:

%acquérir% -> $acquERr$-
%aller% -> $Ir$-
%appeler% -> $appelLer$-
%asseoir% -> $assIÉr$-*
%avoir% -> $aUr$-
%choir% -> $chERr$-*
%dépecer% -> $dépÈcer$-
%devoir% -> $devR$-
%employer% -> $emploIer$-
%envoyer% -> $envERr$-
%être% -> $SEr$-
%faire% -> $fEr$-
%faillir% -> $faUDr$-*
%falloir% -> $faUDr$-
%issir% -> $isTr$-
%jeter% -> $jetTer$-
%pouvoir% -> $pouRr$-
%mouvoir% -> $mouvR$-
%ouïr (trad.)% -> $Oir$-* or $oRr$-*
%payer% -> $paIer$-*
%peser% -> $pÈser$-
%savoir% -> $saUr$-
%venir% -> $vIenDr$-
%valoir% -> $vaUDr$-
%voir% -> $veRr$-
%vouloir% -> $vouDr$-

* Use of these irregular radicaux futurs is optional. For example, the radicaux futurs of %payer% are both payer- and $paIer$-.

Verbs derived from the above verbs use variants of these irregular radicaux futurs. Example:

%devenir% -> $devIenDr$";

"Info.indicatifPrésentHeading" = "Indicatif Présent";

"Info.indicatifPrésentText" = "`Uses`

The ~indicatif présent~ (present indicative) is used:

• To describe continuing reality.

“Mon mari prétend que je n’aime pas les fruits parce que j’en mange moins que lui.” = “My husband claims I don’t like fruit because I eat less of it than he does.”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

• Similarly, to express the repeated or habitual nature of an action. English sometimes uses the construction ~have a habit of + gerund~ to accomplish this.

“[O]ù que je me trouve, dès qu’ils commencent à retentir et à se répondre, je l’$aperÇOis$, avec ses tilleuls et son trottoir éclairé par la lune.” = “Wherever I find myself, as soon as they begin to ring and answer each other, I see it, with its lindens and its moonlit sidewalk.”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

• To emphasize the ongoing character of an action. English uses the construction ~be + infinitive + -ing~ to accomplish this.

“Vois-tu, je $saIs$ que tu m’attends.” = “You see, I know that you $ARE$ waiting for me.”

- Victor Hugo, Demain dès l’aube

• In situations where English uses the construction ~do + infinitive~ for emphasis.

“Oh! très-sincèrement je $souffrE$” = “Oh very sincerely do I suffer!”

- Charles Baudelaire, Le monstre, ou le paranymphe d’une nymphe macabre

`Conjugation`

For most verbs, the indicatif-présent stem is the infinitif minus the -er, -ir, -re, or -oir ending. The indicatif-présent endings for any verb belong to one of the following categories.

1. Regular ~er~ verbs plus couvrir, cueillir, and bouillir: e, es, e, ons, ez, ent

Examples:
%céder%: $cÈde$, $cÈdes$, $cÈde$, cédons, cédez, $cÈdent$
%couvrir%: $couvrE$, $couvrEs$, $couvrE$, $couvrONS$, $couvrEZ$, $couvrENT$
%parler%: parle, parles, parle, parlons, parlez, parlent

2. Regular ~ir~ verbs plus maudire: is, is, it, issons, issez, issent

Examples:
%alunir%: alunis, alunis, alunit, alunissons, alunissez, alunissent
%finir%: finis, finis, finit, finissons, finissez, finissent
%maudire%: $maudIs$, $maudIs$, $maudIt$, $maudISSons$, $maudISSez$, $maudISSent$

3. Regular and certain irregular ~re~ verbs: s, s, _, ons, ez, ent

Examples:
%mordre%: mords, mords, mord, mordons, mordez, mordent
%rendre%: rends, rends, rend, rendons, rendez, rendent
%vaincre%: vaincs, vaincs, vainc, $vainQUons$, $vainQUez$, $vainQUent$

4. %Haïr (Québec)%: ïs, ïs, ït, ïssons, ïssez, ïssent

Example:
haïs, haïs, haït, haïssons, haïssez, haïssent

5. The endings are s, s, t, ons, ez, ent for the following verbs:

%absoudre%, %accroître%, %acquérir%, %asseoir%, %boire%, %choir%, %clore%, %conduire%, %connaître%, %coudre%, %courir%, %croire%, %croître%, %écrire%, %devoir%, %dire%, %exclure%, %faire%, %forclore%, %fuir%, %gésir%, %inclure%, %issir%, %lire%, %moudre%, %mourir%, %mouvoir%, %naître%, %ouïr (trad.)%, %partir%, %plaindre%, %plaire%, %pleuvoir%, %pouvoir%, %rire%, %savoir%, %suivre%, %surseoir%, %taire%, %traire%, %valoir%, %venir%, %vivre%, %voir%, %vouloir%

Examples:
%boire%: bois, bois, boit, $bUVons$, $bUVez$, $boiVent$
%croître%: $croÎs$, $croÎs$, $croÎt$, $croISSons$, $croISSez$, $croISSent$
%gésir%: $gIs$, $gIs$, $gÎt$, $gIsons$, $gIsez$, $gIsent$
%ouïr (trad.)%: $oIs$, $oIs$, $oIt$, $oYons$, $oYez$, $oIent$
%voir%: $vOIs$, $vOIs$, $vOIt$, $vOYons$, $vOYez$, $vOIent$

Most of these verbs use irregular stems for some or all indicatif-présent conjugations.

6. Three verbs are fundamentally irregular in that their stems ~and~ endings are mostly unpredictable. These verbs are:

%aller%: $VAIS$, $VAs$, $VA$, $allons$, $allez$, $VOnt$
%avoir%: $aI$, $As$, $A$, avons, avez, $Ont$
%être%: $SUIs$, $Es$, $ESt$, $SOMMEs$, $êteS$, $SOnt$

Être, avoir, and aller are, respectively, the most, second-most, and eighth-most used verbs in French.";

"Info.passéSimpleHeading" = "Passé Simple";

"Info.passéSimpleText" = "`Use`

The passé simple (simple past) was used for actions that were completed in the past. This use contrasted with that of the imparfait, which was (and continues to be) used for actions that were repeated, habitual, or continuing. The passé simple is no longer used in conversation or writing unless the speaker or writer is self-consciously recondite.

Here are some examples of the passé simple.

“Tresqu’en la mer $cUnquist$ la tere altaigne.” = “He conquered the high land down to the sea.”

- Turoldus, La chanson de Roland

“Me $vInt$ le vouloir de briser la tres amoureuse prison.” = “I $WAS$ seized by desire to break out of the prison of love.”

- François Villon, Le testament

“Emma s’étendit beaucoup sur la misère des affections terrestres et l’éternel isolement où le cœur reste enseveli.” = “Emma $spOke$ at length about the misery of earthly ailments and the eternal isolation in which the heart remains buried.”

- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

“J’entendis les pas de mes parents qui accompagnaient Swann.” = “I $hearD$ the footsteps of my parents, who $WERE$ accompanying Swann.”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

`Conjugation`

For regular ~er~, ~ir~, and ~re~ verbs, the passé-simple stem is the infinitif minus the -er, -ir, or -re ending.

Verbs with irregular participe-passé stems, including most ~oir~ verbs, use those stems for the passé simple. For example, the participe-passé and passé-simple stem of devoir is $D$-.

The passé-simple stem of être, $F$-, though irregular, is related to the English words be and been.

The passé-simple endings belong to one of the following categories.

1. Regular ~er~ verbs plus traire (~a~ group): ai, as, a, âmes, âtes, èrent

Examples:
%parler%: parle, parles, parle, parlons, parlez, parlent
%traire%: $traYai$, $traYas$, $traYa$, $traYâmes$, $traYâtes$, $traYèrent$

2. Regular ~ir~ verbs, regular ~re~ verbs, and certain irregular verbs (~i~ group): is, is, it, îmes, îtes, irent

Examples:
%finir%: finis, finis, finit, finissons, finissez, finissent
%naître%: $naQUis$, $naQUis$, $naQUit$, $naQUîmes$, $naQUîtes$, $naQUirent$
%rendre%: rendis, rendis, rendit, rendîmes, rendîtes, rendirent

3. %Haïr (Québec)%, %haïr (France)%, %ouïr (modern)%, and %ouïr (trad.)% (~ï~ group): ïs, ïs, ït, ïmes, ïtes, ïrent

Examples:
%haïr (Québec)%: haïs, haïs, haït, haïmes, haïtes, haïrent
%ouïr (modern)%: ouïs, ouïs, ouït, ouïmes, ouïtes, ouïrent

4. Certain irregular verbs (~u~ group): us, us, ut, ûmes, ûtes, urent

%avoir%: $Eus$, $Eus$, $Eut$, $Eûmes$, $Eûtes$, $Eurent$
%boire%: $Bus$, $Bus$, $But$, $Bûmes$, $Bûtes$, $Burent$
%être%: $Fus$, $Fus$, $Fut$, $Fûmes$, $Fûtes$, $Furent$
%lire%: $Lus$, $Lus$, $Lut$, $Lûmes$, $Lûtes$, $Lurent$

5. Certain irregular verbs (~bare~ group): s, s, t, ^mes, ^tes, rent

%dire%: dis, dis, dit, dîmes, dîtes, dirent
%exclure%: exclus, exclus, exclut, exclûmes, exclûtes, exclurent
%venir%: $vIns$, $vIns$, $vInt$, $vÎnmes$, $vÎntes$, $vInrent$";

"Info.imparfaitHeading" = "Imparfait";

"Info.imparfaitText" = "`Uses`

The ~imparfait~ (imperfect) is used:

• To express the repeated or habitual nature of an action. English sometimes uses ~would + infinitive~ in this situation, as in the translation below.

“Parfois, à peine ma bougie éteinte, mes yeux se fermaient si vite que je n’avais pas le temps de me dire, ‘Je $m’endoRs$.’” = “Sometimes, barely after my candle $WAS$ extinguished, my eyes would close so quickly that I $dIDn’t$ have time to say to myself, ‘I’$M$ falling asleep.’”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

“[E]lle prenait souvent le café avec Adèle et Virginie, quand les petites avaient de l’argent.” = “She often $haD$ coffee with Adèle and Virginie when the little ones $haD$ money.”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

• To describe past state.

“Il $Était$ chaussé de souliers forts, mal cirés, garnis de clous.” = “He $wOre$ strong shoes, poorly polished, studded with nails.”

- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

“Quels hom esteit ne de quel terre il $eRet$” = “Who he $WAS$ nor what country he $WAS$ from”

- Turoldus, La chanson de Roland

`Conjugation`

With one exception, the imparfait stem is the 1p indicatif-présent conjugation, minus -ons. The exception is %être%, whose imparfait stem is $Ét$.

To the imparfait stem is added ais, ais, ait, ions, iez, or aient.

Examples:
%être%: $Étais$, $Étais$, $Était$, $Étions$, $Étiez$, $Étaient$
%étrécir%: étrécissais, étrécissais, étrécissait, étrécissions, étrécissiez, étrécissaient

"Info.futurSimpleHeading" = "Futur Simple";

"Info.futurSimpleText" = "`Uses`

The ~futur simple~ (simple future) is used for actions expected, predicted, or hoped to take place in the future. Examples:

“[J]e vous garderai une place à côté de moi, et nous causerons.” = “I will save a place for you next to me, and we will chat.”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

“[I]l ne $saUra$ plus l’heure, il estimera qu’il vient à peine de se coucher.” = “He will not know the time[;] he will think he has barely gone to bed.”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

French uses the futur simple in one situation in which English uses the present indicative: in future-time clauses starting with “quand”.

“[J]e les $verRai$ l’année prochaine, quand j’$Irai$ habiter Paris, pour finir mon droit.” = “I will see them next year, when I go live in Paris to finish studying for the bar exam.”

- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

`Conjugation`

- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

• To indicate politeness with %pouvoir%, %avoir%, and %être%.

“Vous ne $pouRriez$ pas me prêter dix sous?” = “Couldn’t you lend me ten cents?”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

“Monsieur Swann, $vouDriez$-vous avoir la bonté de me permettre de vous présenter notre ami Saniette?” = “Mr. Swann, would you be so kind as to permit me to introduce to you our friend Saniette?”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

• In ~si~ clauses about possible or hypothetical situations.

“Si j’$Étais$ à ta place, moi, j’en trouverais bien!” = “If I $WERE$ in your place, I would find some!”

- Victor Hugo, Notre-Dame de Paris

`Conjugation`

For most verbs, the subjonctif-présent stem is the 3p stem of the indicatif présent.

Certain irregular subjonctif-présent stems follow. The first stem on each line is for 1s, 2s, 3s, and 3p. The second stem is for 1p and 2p.

%avoir% -> $aI$/$aY$
%aller% -> $aIll$/all
%pouvoir% -> $pUISS$/$pUISS$
%faire% -> $faSS$/$faSS$
%savoir% -> $saCH$/$saCH$
%croire% -> croi/$croY$
%boire% -> $boiV$/$bUV$
%devoir% -> $dOIv$/dev
%prendre% -> $prenN$/$preN$
%tenir% -> $tIENn$/ten
%venir% -> $vIENn$/ven
%voir% -> voi/$voY$
%vouloir% -> $vEUILl$/voul

To the subjonctif-présent stem is added an ending from one of the following categories.

1. Regular ~er~ verbs, regular ~re~ verbs, and certain irregular verbs: e, es, e, ions, iez, ent

Examples:
%boire%: $boiVe$, $boiVes$, $boiVe$, $bUVions$, $bUViez$, $boiVent$

3. %Haïr (France)% and %haïr (Québec)%: ïsse, ïsses, ïsse, ïssions, ïssiez, ïssent

Examples:
%haïr (Québec)%: haïsse, haïsses, haïsse, haïssions, haïssiez, haïssent
%haïr (France)%: haïsse, haïsses, haïsse, haïssions, haïssiez, haïssent";

"Info.subjonctifImparfaitHeading" = "Subjonctif Imparfait";

"Info.subjonctifImparfaitText" = "`Use`

The ~subjonctif imparfait~ (imperfect subjunctive) was used following the conjunctions ~à condition que~, ~afin que~, ~à moins que~, ~de peur que~, ~pour que~, ~pourvu que~, ~quoique~, and ~sans que~ when the main clause used the %passé simple% or %imparfait%. Use of the subjonctif imparfait is rare in contemporary French.

Examples:

“[I]l semblait ouvrir tout seul, sans que j’$EUsse$ besoin de le tourner.” = “It seemed to open on its own, without me needing to turn it.”

- Marcel Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

“[Q]uoiqu’ils $FUssent$ bruns, ils semblaient noirs à cause des cils.” = “Although they were brown, they looked black because of her eyelashes.”

- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

`Conjugation`

The stem of the subjonctif imparfait is identical to that of the passé simple.

The subjonctif-imparfait endings for any verb belong to one of the following categories, which correspond to the five passé-simple categories.

1. Regular ~er~ verbs plus %traire% (~a~ group): asse, asses, ât, assions, assiez, assent

Examples:
%parler%: parlasse, parlasses, parlât, parlassions, parlassiez, parlassent
%traire%: $traYasse$, $traYasses$, $traYât$, $traYassions$, $traYassiez$, $traYassent$

2. Regular ~ir~ verbs, regular ~re~ verbs, and certain irregular verbs (~i~ group): isse, isses, ît, issions, issiez, issent

Examples:
%finir%: finisse, finisses, finît, finissions, finissiez, finissent
%naître%: $naQUisse$, $naQUisses$, $naQUît$, $naQUissions$, $naQUissiez$, $naQUissent$
%rendre%: rendisse, rendisses, rendît, rendissions, rendissiez, rendissent

3. %Haïr (France)%, %haïr (Québec)%, and %ouïr (trad.)% (~ï~ group): ïsse, ïsses, ït, ïssions, ïssiez, ïssent

Examples:
%haïr (France)%: haïsse, haïsses, haït, haïssions, haïssiez, haïssent
%ouïr (trad.)%: ouïsse, ouïsses, ouït, ouïssions, ouïssiez, ouïssent

4. Certain irregular verbs (~u~ group): usse, usses, ût, ussions, ussiez, ussent

%avoir%: $Eusse$, $Eusses$, $Eût$, $Eussions$, $Eussiez$, $Eussent$
%boire%: $Busse$, $Busses$, $Bût$, $Bussions$, $Bussiez$, $Bussent$
%être%: $Fusse$, $Fusses$, $Fût$, $Fussions$, $Fussiez$, $Fussent$
%lire%: $Lusse$, $Lusses$, $Lût$, $Lussions$, $Lussiez$, $Lussent$

5. Certain irregular verbs (~bare~ group): sse, sses, ^t, ssions, ssiez, ssent

%dire%: disse, disses, dît, dissions, dissiez, dissent
%exclure%: exclusse, exclusses, exclût, exclssions, exclussiez, exclussent
%venir%: $vInsse$, $vInsses$, $vÎnt$, $vInssions$, $vInssiez$, $vInssent$";

"Info.impératifHeading" = "Impératif";

"Info.impératifText" = "`Use`

The ~impératif~ (imperative) is used for commands, instructions, or requests.

Examples:

“N’$aYez$ pas peur, allez!” = “Don’t be afraid. Go!”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

“Ô temps, suspends ton vol!” = “O, Time, pause your flight!”

- Alphonse de Lamartine, Le lac

`Conjugation`

Unlike most other tenses, the impératif only uses three person-number combinations: 2s, 1p, and 2p. For all but four verbs, the 1p and 2p impératif conjugations are identical to their indicatif-présent counterparts.

The 2s conjugations are also identical to their indicatif-présent counterparts except that, if the verb uses the indicatif-présent endings e, es, e, ons, ez, and ent, the s is dropped from the 2s impératif conjugation. Examples:

%parler% -> parle
%couvrir% -> $couvrE$

Four verbs are exceptional in that they use subjonctif-présent stems for the impératif.

%être%: $SOIS$, $SOYons$, $SOYez$
%avoir%: $AIE$, $AYons$, $AYez$
%savoir%: $saCHE$, $saCHons$, $saCHez$
%vouloir%: $vEUILle$/$vEUX$, voulons, $vEUILlez$/voulez

The $vEUILle$/$vEUILlez$ conjugations of %vouloir% are used for polite requests.

“[V]$EUILlez$ monter sur l’épaule de ce garçon.” = “Please step on that boy’s shoulder.”

- Jules Verne, Robur-le-Conquérant

Similarly, these conjugations are sometimes used to close formal letters.

“V$EUILlez$ recevoir, Monsieur, mes plus cordiales salutations.” = “Please receive, Sir, my warmest regards.”

- Office québécois de la langue française, Formules usuelles de salutation";

"Info.passéComposéHeading" = "Passé Composé";

"Info.passéComposéText" = "`Use`

The ~passé composé~ (composed past) is used for completed, choate, non-continuous, non-repeated past actions.

Examples:

“[N]ous avons $faiT$ le voyage avec les deux enfants.” = “We traveled with the two children.”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

“Mais j’ai $Vu$ monsieur d’Ajuda-Pinto entrant chez monsieur de Rochefide, et j’$aI$ pensé qu’alors vous $Étiez$ seule.” = “But I $sAW$ Mr. d’Ajuda-Pinto entering Mr. de Rochefide’s house, and I $thOUGHT$ you $WERE$ alone then.”

- Honoré de Balzac, Le père Goriot

This second example demonstrates why %être%, the most commonly used French verb, rarely uses the passé composé. Past state is usually expressed with the %imparfait%, not the passé composé. %Être% ~does~ use the passé composé for the passive voice, as demonstrated below.

“Lorsque l’assommoir $A$ $paRu$ dans $uN$ journal, il a $ÉtÉ$ attaqué avec une brutalité sans exemple, dénoncé, chargé de tous les crimes.” = “When ‘The Drinking Den’ appeared in a newspaper, it $WAS$ denounced, charged with every crime, and attacked with unprecedented brutality.”

- Émile Zola, L’assommoir

"Info.questionsAndResponsesText" = "~Q:~ How can I contact the developer of ~Conjuguer~?

~R:~ Email vermontcoder@gmail.com.

~Q:~ There is a verb missing from the ~Verbs~ screen. What gives?

~R:~ Feel free to email ~Conjuguer~’s developer at vermontcoder@gmail.com if you would like a verb to be added.

~Q:~ Why does ~Conjuguer~ mostly use French names for tenses rather than English, for example, ~indicatif présent~ rather than ~present indicative~?

~R:~ Admittedly, English tense names would perhaps be more approachable for the learner in certain cases, for example, %radical du futur%. English speakers might better understand the term ~future stem~. But perhaps because of his years working as a lawyer, ~Conjuguer~’s developer values precision in language. English tense names map imperfectly to French tenses. For example, the English ~present indicative~ has more limited uses than the French %indicatif présent%. The English term is therefore an imprecise match for the French tense.

~Q:~ I’ve seen the terms “mood” and “aspect” in descriptions of verb tenses, but ~Conjuguer~ does not use these terms. Also, the %participe passé%, %participe présent%, and %radical du futur% are not really tenses.

~R:~ Was that a question? You are correct that ~Conjuguer~ does not use these two terms, and those three things are not usually described as “tenses”. With respect to terminology, bear in mind that ~Conjuguer~’s purpose is to teach French-verb conjugation, not to teach English French-verb-conjugation nomenclature. With respect to the %participe passé%, %participe présent%, and %radical du futur%, ~Conjuguer~’s developer does consider those three things to be tenses, if “tense” is taken to mean “a systematic way of changing verbs for a specific purpose”. This definition, though absent, on information and belief, from any dictionary, serves ~Conjuguer~’s pedagogical purpose well enough.

~Q:~ Why aren’t there more recent examples of uses of the tenses?

~R:~ French copyright expires seventy years after the death of the author, unless the author died in military service during wartime, in which case the period is one hundred years. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s 1944 death precludes use of “Le petit prince”, ~Conjuguer~’s developer’s favorite French book. Verily, ~Conjuguer~ respects French copyright law, and all example uses of verb tenses are more than one hundred years old.";

David Brodsky wrote “French Verbs Made Simple(r)”, which provided two key insights to the developer of ~Conjuguer~. First, conjugations are combinations of stems, sometimes modified, and endings, usually predictable. Second, every French verb is conjugated using a French-verb ~model~. The number of models is ~much~ smaller than the number of irregular verbs.
